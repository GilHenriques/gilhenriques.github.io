    "text": "I am a theoretical evolutionary biologist, which means I use mathematical models and computer simulations to investigate the interplay of evolutionary and ecological processes. Before transitioning to industry, I researched the evolution of social behaviors such as cooperation and conflict. Past research topics have included sex allocation and biological diversification.\nI use a theoretical approach (with an emphasis on adaptive dynamics and individual‑based simulations), occasionally in combination with empirical work. To learn more about my work, take at look at my publications (below), watch my Ph.D. exit seminar, read my Ph.D. thesis, or get in touch."
